Go Server Pages
===============

Go Server Pages, or "Gosp" for short, is a mechanism for dynamically generating Web pages via server-side code execution.  If you're familiar with [PHP](https://www.php.net/) or [JavaServer Pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages), Go Server Pages is just like those but based on the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/).  The basic idea is that you can embed Go code right in the middle of an HTML documentâ€”or in fact any type of document that your Web server can serve.  The Web server executes the code and includes its output in the page, right where the code originally appeared.  The process is completely invisible to clients, making Go Server Pages 100% compatible with every Web browser in existence.

Example
-------

Let's get down to brass tacks.  Here's a trivial example of a Go Server Page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>My first Go Server Page</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>
      I like the number <?go:expr 2*2*2*3*3*5*7 ?> because it's
      divisible by each integer from 1 to 10.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

The only difference from ordinary HTML in the above is the `<?go:expr 2*2*2*3*3*5*7 ?>` markup.  This tells the Web server to evaluate `2*2*2*3*3*5*7` as a Go expression and replace the tag with the result, producing

    I like the number 2520 because it's divisible by each integer from 1 to 10.

in the HTML sent back to the user's Web browser.  The user has no way of knowing that `2520` was generated dynamically, not entered statically in the HTML.
